ECE 180 Project, Fall 2017

Team members: Jinhao Tang, Sam Vineyard, Yuhan Chen, Siyi Wang, Zexi Chen

**Overview**
* The purpose of this project is to extract useful statistics regarding flight delays in 2016 and create meaningful visualizations for the results.
* This project contains three parts: Airlines, Time, and Location. Our code is organized in this manner.

**Content**
* **2016_data_new**: Data of flight information of 12 months from year 2016.
* **Airline**: Code for plotting delay information regarding airlines.
* **Time**: Code for plotting delay information regarding time variables (hour of day, day of week, day of year, and month).
* **Location**: Code for plotting delay information regarding location variables (state map, airport map, and SAN).
* **Visualization plot**: Some plots created from the data.
